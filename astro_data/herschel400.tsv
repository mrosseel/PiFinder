6781	AQL	PLNNB	19 18.5	#ERROR!	11.8	111"X109"	H III 743	Bright, Large, somewhat elongated at 100X. It is immediately obvious without the UHC filter. This planetary is shaped like the gibbous moon with the south side brighter in an arc. There is one star involved that stands out very nicely. The UHC filter helps some. I estimate its' size at one arc minute.
6755	AQL	OPNCL	19 07.8	#ERROR!	7.5	15.0'	H VII 19	Large, not compressed, irregular shape and has nice chains of stars at 100X. 50 members counted. This object and 6756 both fit in the one degree field of my giant 38mm Erfle eyepiece. I called it the Double Cluster in Aquila. Both clusters are just visible in the 11 X 80 finder.

7009	AQR	PLNNB	21 04.2	-11 22	8.3	28"X23"	H IV 1	is the Saturn Nebula, a famous planetary with outer ansae (wing-like projections) and a bright inner disk. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1782 but Lord Rosse was the first to see the extending ansae. The projections reminded him of the planet Saturn and he gave this object its' nickname. Amateurs have been trying to duplicate that observation ever since. The observation of the Saturn Nebula is made with Helen and Richard Lines' 20" f/6 Newtonian in Meyer, Az. The nebula is bright, small, somewhat elongated and light green at 150X. Raising the power to 225X will show the ansae as faint projections from the bright central section. At 400X the central star is obvious and the ansae stand out more clearly. One of the bright spots along the ansae (Helen Lines calls them wing tanks) is visible at this higher power. All these observations are on a night I rated 7/10 for seeing and transparency and I found that the U 7009 UHC filter did NOT help with either the central disk or the ansae detail. Several observers, myself included saw the nebula as light green, without the UHC filter installed.

There are several stars involved with faint spiral structure in the outer sections in this lovely galaxy. The middle is gradually much brighter. From the darkest sites, the spiral arms of this galaxy shimmer and sparkle with mottling.

There are many dim members in this excellant cluster. Dark lanes wind through this group from edge to edge and give the impression of spiral structure. At 165X the cluster fills the field with many lovely pairs and delicate asterisms. This cluster has been a favorite since my first observation.
1027	CAS	OPNCL	02 42.7	#ERROR!	6.7	20.0'	H VIII 66	Bright, pretty large, pretty rich, somewhat compressed at 135X. 33 stars counted. There is no nebulosity seen, even with the UHC. Page 41 of the Atlas of Deep Sky Splendors shows a photograph with lots of nebulosity in this area. I tried to see it with the UHC and the 38mm Erfle eyepiece and could only pick out the part near Mel 15.
663	CAS	OPNCL	01 46.0	#ERROR!	7.1	16.0'	H VI 31	Counted 69 stars at 100X. Bright, large, very rich, much compressed. Several 8th mag members across the face of the cluster. There is a curved north to south dark lane down the middle of the cluster. This is one of the best Non-Messier open clusters. It is unmistakeable in the 11X80 finder.

136	CAS	OPNCL	00 31.5	#ERROR!	99.9	1.2'	H VI 35	Counted 10 stars at 165X. Faint, small, compressed. Someone has a lot of nerve calling this a cluster.
457	CAS	OPNCL	01 19.1	#ERROR!	6.4	13.0'	H VII 42	Bright, large, pretty rich, compressed. 63 stars counted including Phi Cass, it is a light yellow star at the edge of the cluster at 100X. There is another bright star near Phi that gives the effect of having two glowing eyes looking back at the observer. In the Southwest we call this cluster the Kachina Doll, two sparkling eyes and the rest of the cluster outlines outstreched arms with feathers. Many tribes in the Southwest made such dolls for their rites.
6946	CEP	Sc	20 34.8	#ERROR!	10.5	14'	H IV 76	This face-on spiral galaxy has a low surface brightness and therefore responds to the atmosphere more than edge-on systems. For that reason I have called this object "pretty faint" on a night I rated 5/10 and then called it "pretty bright" on a night that was 8/10 in the mountains of Northern Arizona. In any case it is pretty large, somewhat elongated and has a bright, almost stellar nucleus. Even at the best of times I have never seen spiral structure in this object. There is a very dim extension that forms a 'V' shape.
7510	CEP	OPNCL	23 11.5	#ERROR!	7.9	4.0'	H VII 44	bright, pretty large, somewhat compressed cluster at 165X.I counted 22 members in an irregular shape, with several nice lines of stars. In a wide field eyepiece, cluster King 19 is in the same field.
7380	CEP	OPNCL	22 47.0	#ERROR!	7.2	12.0'	H VIII 77	pretty bright, pretty large, not compressed, triangularly-shaped cluster of 36 stars at 100X. There is nebulosity involved in the cluster, it can be seen without the UHC filter, but the filter helps the contrast very much. The nebula is dim enough that when I use my red flashlight to take notes, the nebula disappears for a few moments when I return to the eyepiece.
7142	CEP	OPNCL	21 45.9	#ERROR!	9.3	4.3'	H VII 66	pretty bright, large, not compressed, rich cluster of 30 stars at 100X.
6939	CEP	OPNCL	20 31.4	#ERROR!	7.8	8.0'	H VI 42	Bright, large, rich, compressed and irregularly round in shape at 135X. I estimated 70 stars, there are lots of dimmer members. This cluster has many lovely chains of stars meandering out into the Milky Way. It is easy in the 11X80 finder.
40	CEP	PLNNB	00 13.0	#ERROR!	10.7	60"X40"	H IV 58	bright, large, and elongated 1.5X1. Central star obvious at 200X. The color is grey at all powers. At 200X and above from one of our best locations, the nebula shows off two brighter ends that look like "polar caps" on Mars. The western cap is larger and brighter. From a poorer site on a night I rated 5/10 for seeing and transparency, the brighter parts of the planetary make it appear to have a spiral shape. The "polar cap" effect only appears on the best of nights.
7160	CEP	OPNCL	21 53.7	#ERROR!	6.1	7.0'	H VIII 67	bright, pretty large, scattered group of 16 stars at 135X. Two 9th mag stars and several fainter ones, not much.

1055	CET	SB	02 41.8	#ERROR!	11.5	8'X4'	H I 1 = H II 6	Pretty bright, pretty large, much elongated (3 X 1), bright middle. Averted vision makes this object grow larger and will just bring out a dark lane running along the galaxy edge.
1052	CET	GALXY	02 41.0	-08 15	12	3'X2'	H I 63	Pretty bright, pretty small, round, much brighter middle. This is the brightest galaxy in a small group. The central three galaxies offer an interresting contrast. NGC 1052 is round and pretty noticeable at 100X. One nearby companion is round and very faint, while another is pretty faint and elongated 3 X 1. They all fit in a 20 mm Erfle eyepiece which has a 30' field and gives 100X on the 13". A very nice grouping.

936	CET	SBa	02 27.7	-01 09	11	5.6'X4.5'	H IV 23	Pretty bright, pretty large, round, much brighter middle. This is a barred spiral, but I could not see any central bar structure.
908	CET	Sc	02 23.1	-21 13	11	5.5'X2.8'	H I 153	Pretty bright, large, elongated 2 X 1, gradually brighter middle. At 165X the core of this galaxy is elongated in the same PA as the galaxy.

246	CET	PLNNB	00 47.1	-11 53	8.5	240"X210"	H V 25	is a very nice planetary to break up all these galaxies. It is bright, large and round at 100X. There are several dark areas in this nebula and they combine to look like this is a doughnut someone took a bite from. The UHC filter makes this effect more noticeable. There are three stars involved at 165X.
247	CET	S-	00 47.0	-20 45	8.9	20'X7'	H V 20	Pretty faint, very large, much elongated (4 X 1) and has a star at one end. It is not much brighter in the middle at 100X in the 13". This object was much more conspicuous in my old 17.5" at 130X. In either scope, this galaxy has a pretty low surface brightness and does not deserve the 10th mag rating it gets in many listings. The outer portions are mottled in both scopes, with good seeing.

2360	CMA	OPNCL	07 17.8	-15 37	7.2	13.0'	H VII 12	Bright, large, compressed, rich and round. Easy in 8X50 finder. At 100X there are about 20 pretty bright stars with another 50 for fill in. This is a winter favorite.
2362	CMA	OPNCL	07 18.8	-24 57	4.1	8.0'	H VII 17	pretty bright, pretty large, somewhat compressed, round at 165X. Tau CMA and about 45 stars. Tau has dark band around it, then cluster members. Tau has two companions that form almost a straight line. Tau is white, the two comes are bluish and both are on one side of Tau. Having a bright triple star in the center of a cluster is quite unique and I return to this object often.

At 200X some fine detail within the dark lane is visible in moments of good seeing at our best sites in the mountains of northern Arizona. It has always looked like the classic flying saucer. At a Saguaro Astronomy Club star party someone called it "God's Frisbee". This spectacular edge-on galaxy is also a companion to Comet Coe. The story goes like this: I had just completed a new 17.5" Dobsonian and had had only few chances to get it out into dark sky. I trucked it to a club gathering at one of the best sites we use. When I observed NGC 4565 it had an obvious companion that I immediatly thought was a comet. After showing it to A. J. Crayon and several other club members, I looked it up and it was quite obvious in a photograph in Burnham's. Oh well, so much for fame 4565 and fortune.

I first saw the blinking effect in an 8" scope at 200X. If you look directly at the planetary the central star is prominent compared to the greenish nebulosity. Then averted vision will make the nebula appear brighter and overwhelm the star. Alternating between direct and averted vision will produce a blinking on-then-off effect that is fascinating. In the 17.5" the effect is unmistakeable. There are several other planetary nebulae that have the right central star to nebula brightness to show off this effect.

A dim glow can be seen in the area with the naked eye and 10 X 50 binoculars at a dark site will show the North America shape. In a 4 1/4" f/4 with a 20mm Erfle and a UHC filter, the nebula is very bright and very large, filling the 1.5 degree field with nebulosity. The brightest section is "Mexico" and the Pelican Nebula (IC 5067) can be seen nearby.

On a night I rated 6/10 for seeing and transparency, down on the floor on the desert near the Organ Pipe Cactus National Forest, I could only resolve 3 stars with a mottled core at 160X. At the same power on a beautiful night in the Red Rock country near Sedona at 5000 ft., this globular blazed with 40 stars resolved, 6 of them in the core area. This is the kind of observation to postpone until those rare 9/10 evenings when stars twinkle very little and the Milky Way blazes overhead.

Using my old 18" f/6 at 210X, I saw 3 stars superimposed on the surface of NGC 7006. One was held steady, the other two appeared and disappeared with the seeing.

Using 250X to 320X there is much detail within the planetary. Two brighter curved areas give the impression of spiral strucure.

Because of the shape of the brighter stars, this is called the Xmas tree cluster and includes the variable S Mon within the tree shape. Binoculars or finder will show the tree outline with ease. The cluster is involved in a faint nebulosity that is brightest near S Mon and on the north side of the cluster. With the 38mm Erfle and the UHC filter the nebula extends for 2 degrees around the star cluster. At 100X with the UHC a dark lane can be seen in the nebula, this is the Cone Nebula. There are very few faint stars in this region a measure of the amount of dark nebulosity that permeates this entire region.

It is often called the Barbell or Little Dumbbell because of its' resemblance to M-27 in Vulpecula. M-76 shows some excellant detail at high powers. I obviously realized this even as a beginning observer because I have observed this object with every telescope I have ever owned. In my 8" f/6 at 150X it showed the dual structure that made William Herschel assign it two numbers. When J.L.E. Dreyer was assembling the NGC he agreed and M-76 is NGC 650 and NGC 651. On a pretty sharp evening at a dark sky site, the 17.5" f/4.5 at 175X brings out several faint loops of nebulosity beyond the bright central bar. There are several dark lanes within the bright inner section. This is with a UHC filter. Without the filter M-76 is a light grey in color. An 18" f/6 makes the ends of the central part brighter than the middle and the 651 faint outer loops are easy with the filter.

The central star will become stellar in moments of good seeing but most of the time it is just a bright area in the center of this planetary. Averted vision will about double the size of the nebula. It was immediately recognized as non-stellar at 100X. This nebula is a nice lime green at all powers.
2438	PUP	PLNNB	07 41.8	-14 44	11	65"	H IV 39	Bright, large, elongated 1.2 X 1 in PA 135, the central star is easy at 100X. Raising the power to 440X brings out several dimmer stars involved in the nebula. Also at the higher power the shape of the planetary is seen to be an incomplete ring, somewhat like a horseshoe. This bright rim is about 270 degrees around and is dimmest on the north side. I have always seen this planetary nebula as light green in color.

253	SCL	Scp	00 47.5	-25 18	7.1	25'X7'	H V 1	is the star of the show in Sculptor. This very large and very bright galaxy was discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1783 during a comet search. From the Cape of Good Hope, her nephew John Herschel called it " a superb object" in the 18" reflector. This spiral is probably the closest galaxy to the Local Group. This object is easily seen in a finder or pair of binoculars. In the 8 incher at 100X this galaxy is over half of a 45' field and displays some mottling. At 130X there are many stellar spots near the core in moments of good seeing. In the larger instruments there are many dark lanes, with swirls and rifts prominent throughout the galaxy to a somewhat brighter core region.
288	SCL	GLOCL	00 52.8	-26 35	8.1	13.8'	H VI 20	is a welcome globular cluster as a break in all these galaxies. This globular is a large, low surface brightness object. It can be seen in 10x50 binoculars as a small, dim spot. The 8" at 100X will resolve 30 stars across the face of this cluster. The larger scopes help some, with more stars resolved. The cluster does not have a brighter core in any of our scopes. A.J. Crayon called it "irregularly round" in the 8". Steve Coe says "roundish" in the 17.5". It sounds as if you will have to go look for yourself.
613	SCL	Sbc	01 34.3	-29 24	11	5.8'X4.6'	H I 281	is pretty bright and quite elongated in the 8" at 80X. This scope will show the outer tips of the spiral arms curved as if to show off their motion. Neither of the larger scopes will bring out that detail. All three instruments will show a brighter core and a pretty bright star on the NE side of the galaxy.
